# Packet Simulator
Implemented a simple network that simulates the arrival of packets based on a specific probability, determines which routers receive them, and indicates whether/when they reach their destination. For this simulator to function properly, the user has to input information such as the packet arrival probability, the number of routers, the maximum size of each router, the maximum number of packets that could arrive at the dispatcher in one simulation unit, the minimum/maximum packet size, and the duration of the simulator.

Language Used: Java

Concepts: Object Oriented-Programming, basic understanding of network, and Data Structure (Queue).

Restrictions: Despite the Scanner class, no API classes are allowed when implementing this project.
